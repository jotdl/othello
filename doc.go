// Package othello provides a very simple and minimalistic abstraction for the game know as othello or reversi.
// Next to a simple model of the game it provides helper methods to make a turn, calculates scores, determine winner and clone the current state of a game (so it's easier to precalculate future turns).
//
// It was primarly made that people can challenge/test their programming skills by coding bots/ais for it.
